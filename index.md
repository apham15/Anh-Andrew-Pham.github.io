### Unsupervised Learning Project: Airplane Crashed

I am a traveler, who always use airplane as the main transportation to discover the world. And My favorite desination is Southest Asia, where I can do snokerling, kayaking, and diving. As a result, when I found this dataset, all my curiousities increase. Let's learn what was the airplane crashing from the past, I may know some insightful that would help me to decide for my future trips. Also, as an Asian, Chinese Zodiac is something very interesting. I did some fun stuff with that to learn more about the data.
