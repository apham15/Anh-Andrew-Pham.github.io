I am a traveler, who always use airplane as the main transportation to discover the world. And My favorite desination is Southest Asia, where I can do snokerling, kayaking, and diving. As a result, when I found this dataset, all my curiousities increase. Let's learn what was the airplane crashing from the past, I may know some insightful that would help me to decide for my future trips. Also, as an Asian, Chinese Zodiac is something very interesting. I did some fun stuff with that to learn more about the data.

### Outcome

#### 1. Airplane Crashing

* USA has the highest fatility cases in the world
* There are over 85% of airplan crashed which are from commercial flights
* Don't fly with Aeroflot Operator, there is 68% chance of you dying.
* Althout it is a military airplane, Don't fly in a Douglas DC-3 aircraft, you are 5 times more chance to dir and it had highest fatalities percentage.
* Don't take any flight that flies Tenerife - Las Palmas / Tenerife - Las Palmas route or Tokyo - Osaka.
* Avoid going to Sao Paulo, Brazil ; Moscow, Russia ; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; they had highest plane crash location.
* It is so much safer to take flight now-a-days as compared to 1970-80, 1972 was the worst years for airline industry.
* Peole who are born in year of Ox have more chance to die, and people who are born in year of Horse have high chance to survive

#### 2. Airplane Fatalities Clustering
* The best clustering algorithms for clustering the fatilities is DBSCAN with eps = 0.01, min sample is 1, and metric is euclidean, which has 2 clusters

#### 3. Text Clustering
* It's hard to determine which is the best method. Overall, The best model which has the highest Silhoette Coefficient Score (0.065) is DBSCAN with eps = 0.01, min_sample = 1, and metric etric='euclidean', which has 4627 clusters
* Personally, I like K-mean because it returns 16 cluster, which is easy to understand and visuallize.

#### 4. Learning from this project
* There is no absolute right answer for clustering. To bring the best results for business solution, I would recomend data scientists consider the best model that fit the business need and apply their business acumen to suggest the best strategy for the whole team.
* My data analysis above is good for travelers around the world to have an insider about traviling with airplane. And it is a good suggestion for operators or aerospace company to look up the disavantages of the past to improve their future businesses.
